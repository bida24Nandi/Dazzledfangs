      <p class="lead">
        Tooth gems, small decorative crystals adhered to teeth, originated in the 1990s as a trend in the hip-hop and celebrity culture. Inspired by flashy dental accessories popularized by musicians, especially rappers, they became symbols of luxury and individuality. Today, tooth gems are applied in a non-invasive way using dental-grade adhesive to attach tiny jewels, gold, or diamonds to the surface of teeth, making them a fashionable way to personalize oneâ€™s smile.
