<h1>The history of tooth gems</h1>

<p>Tooth gems, small decorative crystals adhered to teeth, originated in the 1990s as a trend in the hip-hop and celebrity culture. Inspired by the flashy dental accessories popularized by musicians, especially rappers, these gems became a symbol of luxury and individuality. Over time, tooth gems gained popularity beyond the music industry, spreading to various subcultures. Today, they are applied in a non-invasive way, using dental-grade adhesive to attach tiny jewels, gold, or diamonds to the surface of teeth, and are considered a fashionable way to personalize oneâ€™s smile.</p>
